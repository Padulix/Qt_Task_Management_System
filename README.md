# Qt Task Management System
A C++/Qt-based task Management application.

This project was developed as part of my advanced education in C++/Qt development at Alfatraining. The project involved building a task management application and integrating it with a Microsoft SQL Server database.

## Technologies Used:
- C++ (Qt Framework)
- Qt Creator 13 (Community Edition)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS) v20
- Local database using Microsoft SQL Server

## Known Issues:
- The Drag & Drop functionality does not correctly update the task status. As a workaround, please use the arrow buttons to move tasks between statuses until this feature is fixed.

## Questions
If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.
