# Qt Task Management System
A C++/Qt-based task management application.

## Overview
This is a simple task management system developed using C++ and Qt Creator 13 (Community Edition). The application allows users to manage tasks, store them in a local database using Microsoft SQL Server, and update their status.

## Technologies Used:
- C++ (Qt Framework)
- Qt Creator 13 (Community Edition)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS) v20
- Local database using Microsoft SQL Server

## Compiler and Build Information:
- **Compiler:** Desktop Qt 6.5.3 MinGW 64-Bit
- **Qt Version:** 6.5.3
  
Note: A compiling error occurred with the database functionality when using a version later than 6.5.3 (exact version unknown). Please ensure you are using Qt 6.5.3 MinGW 64-Bit to avoid this issue.

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of my advanced education in C++/Qt development at Alfatraining. The project involved building a task management application and integrating it with a Microsoft SQL Server database.

## Known Issues:
- **Drag & Drop**: The Drag & Drop feature is not yet implemented. Please use the arrow buttons to move tasks between statuses.
