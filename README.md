# Qt_Task_Management_System
Task Management System (written with Qt Creator 13 Community )

Hi, I completed further education as a C++/Qt developer at the company Alfatraining.
At the end of the course, we worked on a project. 
The topic was to create a task management application with Qt and to store the tasks in a database.

To work effectively with a database, we had a two-day introduction to Microsoft SQL.
I used MSSMS version 20  (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) and a local database.
If you have questions, feel free to ask.

P.S. We had to do this in three and a half days, so there are some features that i have to work on. The Programm works fine, but 
i need to work on the Drag & Drop feature, because the status of the tasks don't update probably with it.
So please use the the arrows between the tasks.
